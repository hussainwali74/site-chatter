please optimize the wp_manager. I want modular more interpretable code. better logging, error handling and best practices all around . I would love if you can suggest to make it even better
please do not add any filler placeholders like "// existing code here... " i hate it when you are lazy.

I dont expect you to complete any of these in one go. I think it will be best if we make a list of the major things to do . Then divide the todo list into a plan with each item of the to do list as a major task and creating a concrete and detailed plan to carry out each task to complete the major task.  then moving on to the next. I hope you understand the idea is to go one by one completing one major tasks then analyzing the whole app to get a better sense of thing and then once satisfied with the results then moving to the next. You will ask me for clarifications if you need and i will answer as best as i can. You will be the one to do the planning and the execution and i will be the one to answer your questions and provide you with the necessary information. After completing each task or any subtask you will ask me to check and analyze the app for any issues and i will do so and answer your questions.You will not move to the next step until I do not say so, until I am not satisfied with the results.
maintain a code change_log.md after each major task or subtask. it should  be beautiful and understandable must include detailes of the changes made and the reason for the changes and instructions for how to test the changes.
note: you are responsible for writing the unit tests.

Update code change log after each task/subtask.

Also update Readme.md if you think any change we make is worth updating the readme.
